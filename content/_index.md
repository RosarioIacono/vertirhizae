# VertiRhizae: Mycorrhizae for Vertical Farming {#more-info}

## Rethinking Crop‚ÄìMicrobe Partnerships

**VertiRhizae** is a dynamic platform project at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ) that explores how **beneficial root fungi** ‚Äî known as *arbuscular mycorrhizae* ‚Äî can help crops thrive in **vertical farming systems**.

While vertical farming can reduce land use and make food production more local and resource-efficient, it also removes plants from the **natural soil ecosystems** they evolved in.  
This means plants often grow without their **microbial allies**, leading to lower biomass, reduced stress tolerance, and a loss of flavour and nutritional quality.

Our project focuses on **bringing these beneficial plant‚Äìmicrobe partnerships back** into controlled farming environments to unlock their hidden potential.

## Why This Matters

- üå± **Healthier plants** ‚Äî Mycorrhizae support nutrient uptake and growth, improving yield.  
- üß† **Smarter farming** ‚Äî Microbial interactions can reduce the need for external inputs like fertilizers.  
- ü•¶ **Better food quality** ‚Äî Stronger symbioses can enhance flavour, aroma, and nutrient content.  
- üåç **Sustainability** ‚Äî Vertical farming combined with microbiome support can contribute to more resilient urban food systems.

By understanding how **plant genotypes** and **microbial communities** interact in vertical farms, we aim to **redesign cultivation systems** that are productive, sustainable, and ecologically informed.

## What We‚Äôre Exploring

- How heirloom and wild tomato varieties behave in vertical farming conditions  
- How the presence or absence of mycorrhizae affects plant growth, resilience, and metabolite production  
- Whether reintroducing mycorrhizae can help **bridge the gap between soil-based and soil-free farming**  
- How these effects can inform **future crop breeding strategies**

Our focus on heirloom and wild tomato varieties allows us to **capture a wide range of genetic diversity**, giving us a powerful lens to study how different plants respond to microbial partners.

## How We Work

We combine:
- **Controlled climate chamber experiments** to precisely monitor plant growth  
- **Molecular analyses** (e.g., RNA sequencing) to understand gene expression changes  
- **Chemical profiling** of root exudates to study how plants interact with microbes  
- A **prototype vertical farming system** designed specifically for ecological research

## A Step Toward the Future of Vertical Farming

We envision a future where **microbe-empowered vertical farms** can:
- Deliver **high-quality produce** all year round  
- Rely less on synthetic inputs  
- Support **urban food security** while sparing land for biodiversity  
- Act as **living laboratories** for sustainable crop innovation

This project lays the groundwork for future breeding and management strategies that combine **technology, ecology, and agriculture**.
